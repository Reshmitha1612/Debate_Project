Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,Allowing assisted suicide would enable greedy relatives to take advantage of ill relatives for their own financial gain assisted suicide is just another form of murder.  murder is illegal so assisted suicide must be illegal as well. Assisted suicide is a criminal offense and is a form of assisted murder assisted suicide is a form of murder and should never be allowed. assisted suicide involves murdering someone which is illegal and should be treated as such.,assisted suicide allows terminally ill people to die with dignity and should not be criminalized assisted suicide allows terminally ill persons to choose when to die and do it with dignity. it lets people decide not to live in a state of pain and misery and choose to pass on with human intervention. assisted suicide gives people control over their life in terrible circumstances. it allows them dignity in death rather than living in terrible conditions for many years. assisted suicide allows for a person to die with dignity rather than go through a painful and dehumanizing process. assisted suicide should be made legal so that those who have a terminal illness or are in uncurable pain can make an informed choice to end their lives with dignity surrounded by those they love.,Team B
Entrapment should be legalized,criminals are going to commit the crime either way. by allowing law enforcentment to use entrapment you just catch them sooner and keep that many more people safe. by using entrapment law enforcement is only making it faster to arrest those who are already going to commit the crime therefore saving someone from being a victim. Entrapment causes more criminals to be caught and taken off the streets. entrapment could help put criminals behind bars. entrapment enables law enforcement officers to better remove criminals from the streets,entrapment is an abuse of power from law enforcement and should not be allowed. entrapment is a deceptive method of catching criminals and wastes time and resources that would be better put to use catching active criminals. entrapment encourages people to try and get people to commit crimes which they might otherwise  not have committed. entrapment convinces people to commit a crime when they normally wouldn't and should not be legal. entrapment can lead people to commit crimes or engage in illegal activity by providing opportunities and temptations that they would not normally encounter or act upon.,Team B
Foster care brings more harm than good,"Unlike orphanages in which siblings can largely stay together with the hope of being adopted together, the foster care splits siblings up based on available homes and does very little to try and reunite families. a study comparing more than 22,000 former foster children with their age-matched peers found that the former group had  higher risk of  suicide attempts, risk of psychiatric disorders, and excess risks for psychosis and depression abuse and bullying are rife among foster children
it does not provide stability just temporary solutions there have been too many cases of people fostering just for the money rather than the wellbeing of the child so time to think of a better solution. The foster care system does not have the resources to ensure that every child it places receives the proper care; too many children are neglected and/or abused in their foster homes.","an upbringing with parents rather than an orphanage leads to children who are better socially adapted children are better off in foster care than on the streets or in juvenile detention Every system has its failings, but overall people involved in foster care are loving, devoted individuals with the children's best interests in mind. for some children, it allows them a proper family environment to grow in foster care can provide a child with a family structure.",Team A
Homeopathy brings more harm than good,"believing your body can naturally cure diseases is a bad way of thinking.   these diseases need strong medicine to be administered by a doctor. Homeopathic medicine is an exploitative industry that frequently makes unfounded claims about its effectiveness. homeopathic medicine contains no active ingredient so cannot cure illness, people using this instead of conventional medicine are likely to become more ill. homeopathy can keep some people from getting life saving medications. homeopathy can stop people from accessing proper medical care. this could lead to them not recovering as they should.","Because most of its formulations are heavily diluted, most homeopathic treatments are safe homeopathic medicines are usually used for chronic conditions that are not life threatening and may alleviate symptoms for some adherents but if not there is no harm because the substances are natural. Homeopathic medicine can be effective for treating certain ailments without using intense modern medicine. homeopathic remedies are natural and less harsh than pharmacological treatments. homeopathy brings more good than harm when it is used alongside traditional medical treatments for further alleviation of pain.",Team A
Homeschooling should be banned,"a lot of times, people who homeschool aren't qualified to teach all the subjects needed for a high school  diploma. all children should receive the same education to ensure a standard of learning is established. homeschooling can allow parents to stray for a standardized curriculum, meaning their children receive a sub-standard education that does not ready them for adult life. home-schooled children aren't socialized properly and may have difficulty adapting to the general populace children who are homeschooled may end up being lonely because they aren't socializing with school friends. there could also be the worry that they aren't getting a proper education.","as long as the children follow a standardised curriculum, homeschooling can be a rewarding experience for some people. children who are home schooled do better on tests. children get more one-on-one attention and materials can be tailored to best suit the child's learning needs. children can get more one on one assistance when they are  homeschooled and can learn at their own pace. banning homeschooling takes away the right of the parent to choose the education they feel is best for their children.",Team B
Surrogacy should be banned,"babies should never be for sale so surrogacy should never be allowed. Most surrogacy agreements take part between wealthy, educated white western world couples, and poor, uneducated young woman from the third world. The imbalance here is obvious and harmful. many people have been let down by surrogates that change their minds about handing over the baby and pocketing the money paid for expenses that it is obvious that lack of regulation means it should be banned. it often leads to the exploitation of women surrogacy can lead to the exploitation of poor women for the benefit of the rich.","A ban would be disasterous for the surrogate mothers. Surrogacy will happenn anyway, because the need for it exists, but there will be no health and legal standards for the proccess. couples have the right to explore options for starting a family, and if a third party is willing and able to consent surrogacy should be an option. it allows couples to have children who can't have them on their own. surrogacy gives a family to those who may not be able to conceive some people cannot conceive children for whatever reason, yet they should still have the chance to have a child.",Team A
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,"a vow of celibacy is an archaic stricture that limits the freedoms of priests and harms their relationship with the world as they are less relatable to normal people and are suppressing their natural drives. celibacy has no place in the 21st century as it is nearly impossible to suppress human needs. celibacy is an outdated idea from the early churches. many priests do not live up to the vow they take. celibacy is antiquated and is no longer adhered to in today's modern society, therefore it should be abandoned. celibacy is an outdated ideology and did not apply until recently in religious orders.","celibacy allows the priest to be completely focused on his parish community without distraction. celibacy is a test of faith and an opportunity through denial to express the importance of that faith. if you make a vow its important to keep to it otherwise it becomes worthless it is the bedrock of catholisism that priests are celibate and to abandon this would be expecting catholics to rethink or abandon their beliefs to their detriment. some people choose celibacy to practice their religion.  they should be allowed to do so. if someone takes a vow to devote themselves to a greater purpose, they should be commended for such an unselfish act.  good for them for giving up pleasures of the flesh for something deeper to them.",Team A
We should abandon marriage,"abandoning marriage allows for people to grow as themselves without the weight of a relationship cultural and historical norms associated with weddings are outdated and became a distressing ordeal by adopting such practice we can get rid of all the burdens associate with marriage like financial, legal and social obligations. marriage is an outdated institution for the benefit of the male population, therefore it should be abandoned. marriage is a forced union society seems to think is needed to make a family and indicate loyalty to a significant other. marriage is not needed to prove love.","Even with high rates of divorce, married couples and the children of married parents ultimately have more stable and emotionally healthy lives than their unmarried counterparts. committment and stability are important in the lives of children and marriage provides these qualities marriage helps to maintain the family unit. marriage can show commitment and values it can give you rights and privileges under social security law and tax benefits marriage allows for increased economic freedom due to the combined incomes",Team B
We should abandon television,"abandoning television would encourage people to do other more beneficial activies such as reading, socialising, being outdoors and otherwise healthier pursuits. people can get all of the same information on the internet that they get on tv so there's no need for television. people spend too much time watching television at the cost of more active pursuits people would exercise more and be more productive people are already starting to cut the cord. television is largely being replaced by other forms of entertainment and should be abandoned before it's too late.","for many elderly their only source of company and entertainment is the television. many children learn letters and numbers and a great many things because of educational television people have the right to choose if they want to use their free time in front of the television or anything, everything is based on the freedom of personal choice millions of people depend on the television industry, abandoning it could create an economic crisis in some countries Television has become an integral part of our culture that we should cherish. It not only provides great entertainment, but it's also an excellent educational tool and allows us to keep up with the latest news.",Team A
We should abolish capital punishment,capital punishment can lead to miscarriage of justice of the worst kind capital punishment can potentially lead to the death of innocent men. there are cases where there is strong doubt that the person executed actually carried out the crime. All executions violate the right to life and are a gross affront to human dignity Capital punishment denies due process by making it impossible for new evidence or good behavior to change the sentence. capital punishment is a barbaric and inhumane practice that is outdated.,"A basic principle of punishment is that it should be proportional to the crime, and therefore capital punishment is the only legitimate response to a crime such as first degree murder. all guilty people should be punished and some criminals are simply impossible to rehabilitate and release. capital punishment helps deter crime. capital punishment acts as the ultimate deterrent for the most heinous of crimes, and saves vast amounts of money that would be spent keeping such offenders in jail for ever more. capital punishment can be a deterrent if criminals know this is the ultimate punishment",Team A
We should abolish intellectual property rights,"abolishing intellectual property rights on pharmaceuticals will saves lives, making drugs more accessible. by abolishing intellectual property rights we will allow everyone to expand on ideas and come up with even better products. intellectual property rights keep the costs of life saving products prohibitively high for average people intellectual property rights leads to monopolies, which drives up the prices for consumers. intellectual property rights create a monopoly position for a company which enables them to charge whatever they like for a product without fear of competition. it prices the poor out of markets","a person uses his imagination and hard work to write as book or music.  they should be able to benefit from their work.  it should not be in the public domain. companies invest millions in research and development if other entities are able to use such ideas without prior investment then it's deeply unfair to the companies who developed the ideas. by abolishing these rights, the livelihood of the creators is severely threatened. each person or institution owns their innovations, therefore they must be the owners of the income they generate and there must be intellectual property rights. intellectual property rights are so important in that they don't allow someone to just steal someone else's ideas and creations for their own benefit.",Team B
We should abolish safe spaces,safe spaces are endorsing segregation instead of engouraging debate safe spaces are unnecessary and don’t provide for healthy discourse safe spaces should be abolished because they interfere with progress in reducing discrimination. safe spaces only shield people from the realities of the world and thus leave them unprepared. safe spaces make it more difficult for college students to transition to the real world.,"as long as we have entrenched racist or sexuality based prejudice and violence we continue to need safe places. people need to have a place to turn to in case of emergency where they know they will be protected. safe spaces are a place where minorities of any sort are safe to be who they are and are safe from discrimination, negative comments and harassment and in today's intolerant society are much needed. safe spaces allow for more open communication and hopefully for problem solving.  this is nothing but a good thing. safe spaces allow for people to voice concerns over discrimination and prejudice where they feel protected enough to have the confidence to speak freely. this is a great thing to combat discriminatory behavior.",Team B
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,abolishing the right to keep and bear arms will remove a lot of guns off the street and keep people safer. arms in the hands of private people can lead to more violence in our society and we should ban any of them by abolishing the right to keep and bear arms there will be less guns on the street and less people being killed. Gun ownership only breeds more violence. Guns sold on the consumer market today are inexcusably far too powerful for mere self-defense purposes. gun violence is out of control and guns are getting into the wrong hands,certain groups require firearms such as farmers in rural communities to deal with wild animals which can pose a threat to their crops or livestock. gun ownership is a given right and shouldn’t be taken away. we should be able to have guns for protection most gun owners abide by the law and we should not punish them because someone else committed a crime with a gun people have the right to defend themselves and their property by keeping and bearing arms people have the right to protect themselves and should have the right to keep and bear arms.,Team B
We should abolish zoos,"animals are often kept in poor condition in zoos, with their freedom curtailed. animals are kept in artificial environments that are drastically different in climate and natural vegetation, this is bad for the creatures' health. animals belong in their own environment and not put behind bars and fake environments for our own pleasure and viewing and the concept of zoos should be abolished. animals should be free to live in the natural habitats rather then being kept in close spaces for people's entertainment animals in zoos have been repeatedly found to be malnourished and mistreated.","we cannot close zoos that can help preserve endangered species from extinction some species are endangered and threatened by poaching. zoos are a place were we can guarantee their safety and survival. The caging of animals at Zoos is for the benefit of the species and keeps animals  from extinction. many zoos run breeding programs and protect species in danger of becoming extinct, without zoos we would lose many species around the world for ever! Breeding programs in zoos are saving many animals from extinction. Without these programs in zoos we would be losing losing many more species from the world.",Team B
We should adopt a multi-party system,"a multi party system ensures that everyone’s viewpoint can be represented and taken into account rather than only a minority. a multi party system allows far better choices for the diverse population, meaning they can find someone to vote for that they truly believe in and participate in a democracy better a multi party system would ensure more people get their viewpoint taken into account. a multi-party system allows a greater number of views to be heard. a multi party system would bring many new & fresh ideas into the forefront",a multi-party system could cause too much in fighting between groups that should be cooperating. a multi-party system would be divisive at a time when we need to pursue common interests. Coalitions can be unstable and cause the government to collapse. multiple parties will just confuse people and cause more divisiveness in society Multi-party systems are not efficient. The ruling coalition often has to negotiate with the minority parties in its coalition in order to pass legislation.,Team A
We should adopt an austerity regime,"adopting an austerity regime is necessary when our country is struggling, it is the only was to ensure a flourishing economy in the future. ending the debt ensures our country does not collapse. adopting an austerity regime is the best way to reduce the budget deficits we currently are faced with an austerity regime can help restructure a country's debt without increasing the deficit adopting an austerity regime would reduce government debt. an austerity regime can save the country money and reduce the national debt.",adopting an austerity program will ultimately hurt us more by cutting funding on important programs and increasing our taxes. an austerity regime hurts the poorest in our society adopting now an austerity regime will  sink the local economies and prevent any growth in scientific research for technological  improvement. adopting an austerity regime would put undue burden on the taxpayers austerity forces the poorest sections of the population into greater poverty.,Team B
We should adopt gender-neutral language,a gender neutral language should be adopted so that conversations and language would be fair for everyone. adopting a gender neutral language enables us to speak to each other in a more compassionate and understanding way. by adopting gender-neutral language there will be more equality and nobody will feel offended or excluded by adopting general-neutral language usage we send a clear message to children growing up that life is not segregated or determined by one's sex. adopting gender-neutral language helps the process of cultural change necessary for equality of the sexes,"adopting a gender neutral language may take away from ones identity. gender is part of a persons identity. gender neutral language is ambiguous and confusing for the listener gender characteristics are part of a person's identity, by using gender neutral language we invalidate those characteristics adopting gender-neutral language would be taking the political-correctness of society a step to far. gender and diversity are to be celebrated not ignored. gender-neutral language is not necessary and will confuse people.",Team A
We should ban cosmetic surgery,"a lot of times the physical and emotional after effects of cosmetic surgery defeat the main purpose of getting the surgery. cosmetic surgery can be dangerous, sometimes resulting in death. it reinforces the belief in the social standard of beauty.  it can victimize our teens and is becoming very lucrative for the doctors pushing it. cosmetic surgery contributes to the mythical ideal body, the pursuit of which causes depression, anxiety and eating disorders in young people. cosmetic surgery creates an unhealthy self image cosmetic surgery creates a great desire for physical improvement that leads to an endless loop of body adjustments which has a detrimental effect on the individual.","banning cosmetic surgery would prevent those hurt in an accident or anything similar from getting back any part of their normal previous selves. cosmetic surgery aids in reconstructive surgeries such as those who have has a mastectomy or have physical repairable birth defects. cosmetic surgery allows those hurt in accidents, or disformed in other ways,  feel better about themselves my regaining some of their natural looks. banning cosmetic surgery would force people with disfigurements to live that way the rest of their lives which would cause emotional problems. cosmetic surgery can help improve one's self-image in cases of disfiguration and injuries that may have left physical damage that can be repaired with this type of procedure.",Team B
We should ban cosmetic surgery for minors,"young people's bodies are not yet fully developed and there should be no surgical intervention unless strictly necessary. a child is still growing, physically and mentally, cosmetic surgery should not be considered until they are an adult and able to make these decisions a child's body is still developing and the faults that a child sees in themselves may resolve when they're an adult young people are still developing, and cosmetic surgery done too soon could hamper their development and harm their self-esteem young children are not capable of knowing what is necessary and what isn't","bullying and insecurities are rampant in a teenagers world. it has very serious effects. if a little bit of plastic surgery would solve this, it should be allowed. it's worth it to prevent major emotional pain. burn victims, even minors, can benefit from cosmetic surgery. Broad stroke policies like banning cosmetic surgery harm people in special circumstances who really need cosmetic surgery. even minors have the right to bodily autonomy and should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to have cosmetic surgery. if a child is born with congenital defects, then cosmetic surgery can help them to lead a normal life.",Team A
We should ban fast food,"Fast food can lead to obesity, heart disease and other health problems if not taken in moderation. fast food causes obesity and many illnesses including heart problems or even cancer. fast food has lead to an increase in obesity and diabetes fast food has proven to be detrimental to the health of all people and should be banned immediately. Fast food is a leading cause of obesity in the world and needs to be banned.","Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they eat and fast food is perfectly fine when eaten in moderation, it also plays an important purpose in modern society so it definitely should not be banned. fast food offers a variety of healthy choices and is convenient for those in the workplace that do not have time for making a full meal. Fast food provides a cheap and consistent meal for many people who see it as an occasional meal or treat and this should not be restricted because others cannot make good dietary choices. fast food is great for when you are travelling or have done overtime at work; it enables you to get something hot to eat when you don't have the time to prepare it yourself. fast food is a quick and affordable option for many people.",Team A
We should ban naturopathy,"a consumer doesn't know what's really in natural remedies since there is no regulation we should ban naturopathy since it has no scientific basis and has no medical benefit beyond the placebo effect. a lot of naturopaths suggest things without scientific backing, which may harm the patient. we should ban naturopathy because it is dangerous for people to not see real doctors. they are risking their own health but also can spread their diseases to others if they don't get treatment. there is no scientific evidence that shows naturopathy works","we should not ban naturopathy because some people, who are no longer good candidates for traditional treatment, might receive some benefit for a natural treatment at the end of their lives. we should allow people to choose their own treatment.  banning naturopathy is government overreach. we should allow naturopathy to continue as it provides treatments that at less harmful to the body compared to the man made chemicals. we cannot write off all naturopathic treatments, if we had done so in the past there would be no modern medicine today there is nothing wrong with seeking more natural remedies than relying on harmful and addictive pharmaceutical drugs.",Team A
We should ban telemarketing,"it is a form of harassment to be contacted constantly by telemarketers. it is annoying and violates people's privacy telemarketing is a pock mark on society. it disrupts peoples lives, causes extreme aggravation and pushes unwanted products and services on the poor, elderly and those prone to being taken advantage of. telemarketers exist only to scam people out of their money. they lie and use dishonest marketing tactics to get consumers to bend to their will. telemarketers are a nuisance and waste our valuable time.","Banning is an extreme measure, it should be used only when real harm is done, which isn't the case here.

We should ban the use of child actors,"acting takes children away from their education and normal childhood pursuits child actors are forced to grow up much too soon and behave as though they are adults. we need to give them chance to be children. child actors are forced to work really long hours, and are usually taken out of regular school, possibly harming their development. Child acting is causing a lot of children to be exposed to grown up situations resulting in earlier sexual activity and drug use. They don't do things a normal child does and it usually causes depression. child actors are all too often traumatised or abused so their use should be banned.","acting is an art and not a job so banning the use of children in acting roles is preventing children from exploring their creative ability in that area and should not be banned. as long as the child really wants to do it and is being properly supervised, they should be allowed to act. banning child actors is simply impractical; it is better to enforce regulation to protect these actors. children make important contributions in the entertainment industry.  banning child actors punishes the victims rather than the perpetrators of predatory or exploitative behavior children should be able to follow their passion too as long as it’s done safely and responsibly",Team A
We should ban whaling,"Animals have rights, and we as custodians of nature have an obligation to them to protect them from this cruel and needless death banning whaling would help save the already diminished whale population. banning whaling is the most humane thing we can do to help. It is impossible to humanely kill a whale and no creature deserves such a painful and gruesome death. killing whales is cruel and inhumane and if we don't ban it now we risk losing the entire whale species.","Banning will not work.

We should cancel pride parades,"pride parades bring town life to a standstill when roads are closed. it is also offensive to some people. pride parades are unnecessary in the modern west as we recognise the freedom of people to engage in consensual same sex relationships already. pride parades bring negative attention to the lgbt community and should be stopped pride parades are a drain on public resources due to the security costs incurred. pride parades are often focal points for civil unrest and protest of extremist groups, and thousands of police hours are occupied by them.","cancelling pride parades goes against what they stand for.  those parades are vital for spreading acceptance. pride parades allow lgbtq community to have something to rally around. Pride parades allow communities to be open and free about their lifestyles in a way that everyone else can all the time, they are fun, community events that go beyond the LGBTQ communities. pride parades are a celebration of life and are generally peaceful and happy. if pride parades are canceled, then many lgbtq+ youth will have nowhere to safely celebrate who they are.",Team B
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,"any prison system that inflicts torture is against the laws of the u.s.a. and should be stopped. By violating the human rights of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. loses its authority to request from other countries to stop their human rights violations. guantanamo bay detection camp has violated human rights agreements and should therefore be closed at once. Creating such a secluded environment for this detention camp has encouraged and legitimized unlawful and immoral behaviour on the part of the soldiers in charge of the detainees. Circumventing the law by building detention camps off of US soil makes a mockery of the very institutions America is trying to protect.","america needs a place to safely incarcerate the most heinous of terrorists and state enemies safely to protect its citizens. guitmo does this perfectly guantanamo bay detection camp has proven to be effective in dealing with modern terrorism, so we should be happy to keep it guantanamo bay detection camp offers an essential form of law enforcement and imprisonment for serious criminals and has provided important intelligence in ongoing surveillance. guantanamo bay allows the extraction of information from terrorists, information that is vital to our national security guantanamo bay should not be closed because it is able to successfully house dangerous criminals.",Team A
We should end affirmative action,"affirmative action breeds resentment in the workplace and demoralization in the job market affirmative action bypasses people who may be highly skilled but as they are not in a protected minority class can be turn down for employment by someone less skilled. affirmative action breeds further resentment toward groups of society that are or were the subject of discrimination. equal opportunity is the best approach affirmative action discriminates the majority, preventing skilled workers from gaining employment over someone less qualified but considered to be a member of a protected minority group. Affirmative action diminishes the credit that women and minorities receive for their accomplishments, as people will claim their success is due to systems of affirmative action rather than their own hard work.","affirmative action  is still needed when there is inequality in society. affirmative action corrects for generations of wrong-doing and should not be discarded. affirmative action allows those who may be marginalized to progress in the work environment Affirmative action doesn't remove the need to be qualified in order to receive acceptance at a job or university, but rather forces institutions to consider people of diverse backgrounds when they historically haven't. affirmative action ensures minorities from lesser backgrounds have a chance at employment or schooling",Team A
We should end mandatory retirement,"as people are living longer mandatory retirement is forcing those who can still positively contribute to the workforce  to be sidelined as life expectancy and healthy ageing continue to grow mandatory retirement no longer makes sense. Allowing workers to choose when they retire can improve staff retention, increase workforce morale, and help employers retain vital skills and experience Ending mandatory retirement sends the message that workers of all ages have inherent worth. Ending mandatory retirement will help reduce the burden of older populations on state pension systems.","if retirees continue to work past retirement age, there will never be a natural progression through the workplace for the younger generation. by having mandatory retirement we are opening job positions for the younger people who need to being their workforce life. they bring new ideas to the workforce that will benefit society. certain professions, such as police officer and air traffic controller, have mandatory retirement ages  to ensure that the person who is responsible for the safety of others remains competent to do his job By freeing up space across professional hierarchies mandatory retirement provides more opportunities for career growth and upward mobility for younger people. at many physical jobs, having someone past a certain age can become a liability and a mandatory retirement age will be a good leveling tactic.",Team B
We should end racial profiling,it enforces the stereotype that all people of a certain race are dangerous criminals no one should be thought to be suspicious just because of their race or color. It is immoral to target a particular group based simply on their race of ethnicity. it is discrimanatory to use racial profiling which in turn alienates those on the receiving end of this type of profiling. it is a racist policy and should have no part in a civilized society,"any statistical study and classification methods that can improve detection rates and cut crime are valid, irrespective of how ethically sensitive they might be. racial profiling allows for identifying known criminals that belong to certain minority groups, decreasing a vast number of potential suspects in a case. figures show that certain crimes are perpetrated more by certain races, thus racial profiling is a helpful shortcut for law enforcement. racial profiles helps law enforcement agencies to target their resources to where they are most effective racial profiling targets the people and populations most likely to cause or commit crimes and allows law enforcement to put their time to more effective use.",Team A
We should end the use of economic sanctions,economic sanctions affect the poor more than the tyrants economic sanctions are controversial and punish primarily innocent and poor people who are living on a day-to-day basis to get something to eat Economic sanctions are a threat that does not result in any action by the government and often hurt the populations of both countries rather than those in power therefore we should end them. economic sanctions affect the workers of the sanctioned countries and not the leaders economic sanctions affect the poorest in the country affected and those at the top do not feel the effects,"by imposing economic sanctions against a country you will force them to change the way they are doing things because it creates a hardship for the citizens who will in turn rebel against the government economic sanctions are a good thing. we need to take care of our own people first and economic sanctions can make that happen. economic sanctions are a vital peaceful method of deterring, reversing and punishing behavior that infringes for example international treaties or international human rights. there is no better alternative economic sanctions are a peaceful and effective way of encouraging diplomacy and affecting change in countries committing unethical acts, without the use of any violence economic sanctions are a viable and peaceful alternative to war",Team A

We should introduce compulsory voting,"a high turnout is important for a proper democratic mandate and the functioning of democracy a low turn out means that the elected government does not represent the true wishes of the country. making voting compulsory would mean that an elected government had a true mandate. a lack of voting leads to a situation were their isn't fair representation in parliament. by requiring all citizens to vote, we would be able to elect politicians who more accurately represent the public's will. all citizens should be compelled to vote to voice their opinion on who should be our elected leaders. apathy in selecting our political leaders is detrimental to our society.","being forced to do anything inhibits freedom. citizens have freedom to choose if they want to participate in the political  process including abstaining from voting if they choose. forcing a person to vote dilutes the meaning of the process. compulsory voting is not a democratic choice, for people  should always be allowed to express their dissent by abstaining from voting . compulsory voting is a violation of civil rights compulsory voting is an infringement on personal choice",Team A
We should legalize organ trade,"a democratic and free society is said to respect bodily autonomy, therefore we should have the right to do what we want with our organs, including using them in a legal organ trade a legalised organ trade would increase the amount of stock available for medical procedures, and allow the procedure to become safer and more regulated. a legalised organ trade would dramatically improve the stock of transplant organs, saving lives. by legalizing the organ trade you are keeping it out of the black market and the criminals who are already making money off it. as long as they are properly informed, someone should be allowed to sell organs for compensation if they so choose.","A legalized market would exploit the poor who, as a result of financial problems, would be the ones most likely to sell their organs. by allowing the organ trade the poorest of society will resort to selling body parts just to survive which will harm them in the end. legalizing the organ trade can lead to a black market for organs, where people could be kidnapped just to have their organs confiscated. legalising the organ trade would be unethical. allowing people to buy and trade organs would place a burden on the poorest people, as they would feel pressure to sell their organs. legalizing organ trade could lead to some horrific situations such as organs being taken from unwilling donors.",Team A
We should legalize polygamy,"as long as there is no forced marriages going on and these people absolutely love each other, and the others that person is married to doesn't effect them, why can't we make it legal? everyone should have their own right to choose who and how many people they want to marry, it is unconstitutional to limit this. consenting adults should be able to marry as many people as they want in this day and age, we recognize non-traditional family structures as legitimate and polygamy should be no different. legalizing polygamy could result in much more stable lives for many families, more adults in the house would mean less strain on finances and more people to care for the children.","Children who grow up in polygamous households have poor academic performance compared to those who grow up in monogamous families. in a polygamous relationship, a wife can become more obedient to her husband fearing that she might be replaced with a new wife marriage is about loving another person and being faithful to that person for life.   there is none of that when there is polygamy.   men should not be allowed to have multiple marriage partners. Legalizing polygamy will cause the rate of mental health issues to climb as people become more and more insecure about their spousal relationships. it's an outdated practice that is detrimental to the equality between men and women.",Team B
We should legalize prostitution,"women should have the right to decide what to do with their body and that should include being able to sell it. a man or woman has the right to do what they wish with their body, and if they choose to sell it for sex, the government should not interfere. being able to control prostitution will allow us to drastically reduce some crimes and better serve the health of the workers and prevent the spread of sex diseases a woman should have the right to use her body however she wants to support herself. legalising prostitution will ensure the safety of both the sex trade worker and client","banning prostitution is must for all of us who cares about moral and dignity of women. legalizing prostitution has the potential to increase sex trafficking legalising prostitution could lead to more serious crimes such as women becoming involved in the drug trade or people trafficking. prostitution can lead to human trafficking, even of children Prostitutes are subject to cruel and degrading treatment by both their pimps and clients.

We should legalize sex selection,families should have the right to choose the sex of their babies. parents should have the right to decide what gender of child they want. legalizing sex selection is the right thing for personal freedom of choice. legalizing sex selection is a good option for people looking to have a specific sex of child. Legalizing sex selection will help parents to have the exact family makeup they have always dreamed of.,"allow the selection of sex could alter the natural order of things Behind the innocent phrase  of""sex selection"" there's actually medical procedures that could be harmfull for the mother, and in other cases means abortions, which are very controversial. every child has a right to be born regardless of their gender so sex selection should not be legalized. most people believe that sex selection is immoral and unethical and leads to serious societal issues. legalizing the selection of sex goes against the moral and natural principles of society",Team A
We should limit executive compensation,"executive compensation is a joke. it's executives rewarding themselves on the backs of shareholders regardless of how well a company performs. executive compensation creates a barrier between the ""executives"" and the ""workers"" and should be limited to a level that doesn't create such a different world between the two Executive compensation should be limited as it is discouraging for a workforce when they can see higher management being paid exorbitant amounts of money. executive compensation should be limited in order to narrow the wage gap between c-level employees and line workers executive compensation is abuse of unregulated capitalism and concentrates wealth into a very small number of people.","attracting the best talent means companies have to offer the best executive compensation package they can afford for the future profitability of the company. companies should be allowed to pay their staff as much as they wish to by paying executives a high amount of money, companies can get a better quality of leadership leading to a more profitable business. executive compensation allows companies to get the best talent executive compensation should not be limited because it would act as a barrier to companies that have to compete in the international marketplace for the best talent",Team A
We should limit judicial activism,"a judge's role is not to flaunt laws and override guidance but to enforce it. judicial activism is a step too far a judge's opinion should not take precedent over official laws. a judge is suppose to uphold the rule of law, not alter it with their own opinions/views/beliefs. judicial activism allows judges to play a legislative role which destroys the balance of power inherent to our form of government judicial activism can be used to push  an agenda that does not line up with the country's best interest.","judicial activism can be beneficial if a judge rules in favour and over turns rules that have previously predjudiced against minorities or unfair rules judicial activism allows lawful recourse in circumstances of possible justice miscarriages, and is an extra protection against possible corruption and obstructive 'influence' in the higher court. judicial activism can be beneficial in some cases. judicial activism allows poorly or misconceived legislation to be reconsidered if the legislature and/or executive branches violate the constitution, judicial activism is a remedy for this.",Team A
We should oppose collectivism,"As people are randomly born into the world and largely do not choose the community they are born into, they should not be obligated to serve the collective as they did not consent to its existence. collectivism does not allow for individual enterprise and it stifles entrepreneurism. collectivism  hurts creativity and any new ideas and it slows down progress collectivism can cause people to ignore important problems if it doesn't apply to certain groups collectivism can destroy individuality and can cause people to be singled out in a bad way.","collectivism can help instill pride and patriotism in a country. collectivism can be useful for instance in a group of people they will all have different strengths and ideas and therefore are better at solving problems collectivism assures that the weakest members of society have access to basic needs. collectivism aims to work toward what is good for all rather than a single person or group, this means a better society for everyone collectivism allows for focused intervention for a specific issue using all tools and means necessary to fix a situation.",Team A
We should prohibit flag burning,"burning the flag is complete disrespect for each and every man and woman who has fought and died for the right to fly that flag. burning the national flag can incite hatred and therefore it should be banned. Flag burning dishonors veterans who have sacrificed lives and health for the country, and should be banned. flag burning is an offensive action against those who have risked their lives or died defending that flag.  those who burn that flag should be arrested. flag burning is an affront to our country.","a flag is no more than a symbol, if flag burning were banned you would have to ban the burning of football shirts, etc burning a flag is a form of speech. as free speech is a constitutional right, we should not ban it. flag burning is a form of free speech. flag burning is a form of expression, so a ban would be unconstitutional. Flag burning is a legitimate form of freedom of expression. As such, it is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.",Team A
We should stop the development of autonomous cars,"automated cars will displace a lot of people working today and a lot of people will need to be retrained for other jobs. (if they exist.) an autonomous vehicle can never be programmed to make an ethical decision if faced with a crash situation autonomous cars are a danger to the general public.  there have already been deaths and injuries that would have never happened within a regular vehicle. autonomous cars are dangerous because they are operated by a computer which can malfunction or be hacked. autonomous cars are dangerous and shouldn't be allowed.  we all know technology fails often, and allowing someone to put their life (and the lives of those around them) in jeopardy is not necessary in this way.","autonomous  cars are safer because they don't fall asleep, don't drink and drive, and their reaction time is faster and more accurate than a human. autonomous cars are likely to be safer than human controlled cars because they remove the factor of human driver error. autonomous cars are a lot more reliable than human drivers autonomous cars are no more dangerous than distracted drivers, and autonomous driving can allow the drivers to do other tasks. autonomous cars are safer because they eliminate human error",Team B
We should subsidize Wikipedia,"Subsidizing Wikipedia will help it develop and improve,  which will improve the quality of education- since many students use Wikipedia as a learning tool Subsidizing Wikipedia will help it encompass more knowledge, generating the greatest, unbiased documentation of life on earth as we know it. subsidizing wikipedia would improve the resources available for moderating its content, improving the accuracy of the information. subsidizing wikipedia would increase contributions and increase reliability because facts could be verified. we should certainly subsidize wikipedia because it is an open source dictionary and encyclopedia that has millions of users. without it, there will be much less learning and information available.","A government-funded Wikipedia would become a government-controlled Wikipedia. If Wikipedia were subsidized it would be less objective by being accountable to a single funding source. if the government provides funding to wikipedia the impartiality and therefore reliability of the information held on there may be compromised government subsidies open the door to government control, this would potentially ruin the impartiality of wikipedia it could lead to donors trying to influence the content",Team A
We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research,"by subsidizing embryonic stem cell research, cures will be made available for diseases that would otherwise cost millions more money for long term treatments that sustain life instead of curing the disease. diseases can be cured using cells created for embryonic stem cell research. embryonic research has proven effective in finding cures for many diseases such as cancer. embryonic stem cell research can find a cure for various diseases. embryonic stem cell research can help discover new cures for life threatening illnesses.","destroying human embroyos for research is unethical and immmoral embryonic stem cell research is unethical and immoral. embryonic stem cell research should not be subsidized because it requires the destruction of human embryos and so raises serious ethical concerns. embryonic stem cell research is ethically unsound, and the long term consequences are unknown. embryonic stem cell research is controversial and therefore should not receive government funding.",Team A
We should subsidize journalism,"Due to the rise of instant gratification online media and the fall of print media, journalism has been struggling economically a lot more in recent times. Subsidization will pull it out of the slump. journalism is imperative to a fully functioning democracy Journalism is an important part of our political system; it keeps citizens informed and exposes government corruption. Journalism is a vital source of real information and news to make sure people are properly informed about the world so subsidizing it would help ensure that it continues without bias. journalism helps tell everyone in the world the current news that they might not otherwise hear.","if subsidised by the government then they might be biased, afraid of losing the money if journalism is funded by the government the government will regulate the news journalism needs no help, there is a vast array of ways to get information and subsidizing it would only create polarization of information journalism should be able to stand on its own without the taxpayers being forced to contribute to its upkeep journalism should not be subsidized because subsidies could too easily be allotted according to political beliefs.",Team A
We should subsidize space exploration,"developments in science and technology have been accomplished through space exploration by subsidizing space exploration we can work toward colonizing other planets and reduce over population on earth. Space exploration allows researchers valuable information into the universe. knowledge is power and each new discovery can be applied to countless other things that can benefit our daily lives it is estimated that the economic value of every dollar spent on the space exploration program is worth $8-$10, this makes it a very sound investment that advances technology, science and medicine.","space exploration is an expensive vanity project and subsidization could be abused by military and private interests. space exploration is a waste of taxpayers money and should be funded by private enterprises. space exploration is a waste of public funds when people are suffering from food poverty and lack of housing. The money could be better spent on more worthy areas, such as health and education. Subsidizing space exploration would only cause our country to go deeper in debt.",Team A
We should subsidize stay-at-home dads,"a modern society espousing gender equality has a duty to subsidize stay-at-home dads, just as it would support mothers - this both improves womens' career prospects, and fathers' emotional bonding. Children flourish when a parent is their primary caregiver, but it nearly impossible to raise a family on one salary. Subsidizing stay-at-home dads would benefit such families. men and women too who stay at home to raise a family should get some type of subsidy.  nothing is more important than children growing and learning from a loving parent. Even in today's world pay inequality is a fact and this means that dad's cannot afford to stay at home, a subsidy is essential to allow dads the same opportunity as mums. dads do not always get the same bonding experience the mother gets due to not being able to afford to take time off work to be with their babies and children so subsidising would make for better family life.","a father is entitled to sacrifice his work for time with his new-born, but this is a lifestyle choice and should be self-funded, not financially supported by the tax payer. being a stay at home parent is a choice and it's no one else's responsibility to ensure an individual can stay at home with their children. having a child is a choice. why should we subsidize people that chose to have a child they cannot afford? stay at home dad's chose to be parents. no other citizen should pay to subsidize their lifestyle choice, especially the many citizens that have not had children of their own because they cannot afford to we don't subsidize stay at home moms so we whouldn't subsidize stay at home dads.",Team B
We should subsidize student loans,"a majority of students are unable to pay for the high cost of attending college All young people whether rich or poor should have the opportunity to better their lives by going to into higher education, the more student loans are subsidized the closer this will become a reality. an educated population is a productive population, and it ultimately makes financial sense for a government to support learning activities in return for enhanced taxation revenue down the line. by subsidising student loans governments can encourage those on a low income to consider university. an education is very important nowadays and subsidizing student loans will help many students go to school","going to college is a benefit for the person attending and they should bear the full cost. the government should not spend it resources to  help kids go to college, there are many other more important needs. if people can't afford a high education then the burden of paying for them to have this shouldn't be put on other people by subsidizing. the can always get a job doing other things. people choose to go to college.  those that do should pay the bills for that schooling.  we should not be taxed to give money to those that choose to borrow it. loans should not need to be subsidized as the students can pay them back when they are earning enough, which will be thanks to their education. while in theory it would be nice if no students had loan debt it is not possible. it would take away from other necessary funds like social security, universal health care, and military defense.",Team A
We should subsidize vocational education,"academic education has been promoted at the expense of vocational education and this needs to be re-balanced by subsidizing vocational education. not all high school graduates complete a college degree and some of them get jobs that don't even require a degree, vocational education would really help them get better jobs than otherwise available to them. Many of the careers offered at vocational schools provide  essential services to the community. not everyone is suited to work in an office. we also need mechanics and truck drivers and hair dressers etc. by subsidizing voed for these jobs we will be able to continue to teach the hands on employees. it provides people the skills needed to get a good job","making the training free will cause less motivated people to take up valuable training resources We should not subsidize vocational education but should ensure that businesses are involved to offer apprenticeships and make sure that the courses are relevant to job needs. we pay enough school tax in every county towards helping out our schools.   we don't need our other tax dollars being used for what schools should be paying for already with our tax money. vocational education is a specialized educational outlet and should be paid by the person who chooses the path of vocational education. we should not subsidize vocational education because it would cost to much and raise taxes, and it would not help society in the long term.",Team A
